# Space Drone
You are a drone pilot and can shoot at weird blobs. A prototype or less. Made for godot wild jame 20.

**Attention:** Most of this is probably bad practice as I ran out of time. Do not use this code as an example how to make a game... Especially the commit "Add weird mess to finish game before deadline" with roughly 1000 changes added a lot of bad stuff.
